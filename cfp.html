<p>We invite submissions that jointly focus on data-driven learning and knowledge, logical, rule-based and commonsense reasoning. They may describe completed research or work-in-progress. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trustworthy machine learning using knowledge reasoning, extraction and integration</li>
  <li>Knowledge and logic reasoning for counteracting bias, variance, and uncertainty of data</li>
  <li>Knowledge utilization for efficient data generation and labeling</li>
  <li>Knowledge graphs combined with language and vision models for better generalization</li>
  <li>Natural language reasoning for large language models</li>
  <li>Knowledge graphs for verification of generative models</li>
  <li>Factual grounding and attacking hallucination</li>
  <li>Scaling task and instruction-based fine tuning of LLMs</li>
  <li>Knowledge retrieval, knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction</li>
  <li>Relational and graph based reasoning</li>
  <li>Contrastive learning for reasoning</li>
  <li>Semantic search and hypothesis discovery</li>
  <li>Automated theorem proving and deductive, abductive and inductive reasoning</li>
  <li>Physical laws and neural networks - geometric deep learning</li>
  <li>Neural algorithmic and logic reasoning</li>
</ul>

<p>Submissions will be reviewed in a double-blind setting. The workshop is non-archival and will not have any official proceedings. Based on the PC’s recommendation, the accepted papers will be allocated either a contributed talk or a (virtual or in-person) poster presentation.</p>

<p><b>We offer a Best Paper Award and several travel grants (complimentary ICML conference registrations).</b></p>
